Requirements:
- Create two endpoints that are suitable to replace localStorage in the previous assignment (persisted-addition)
  - one for localStorage.setItem and another for localStorage.getItem
  - For each case, consider
    - which url route you should use
    - which HTTP Method you should use
    - which HTTP response code you should use
    - should the endpoint return any data or object?
- Remove all other endpoints and unused classes in the project
